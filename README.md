## A writing style idea/game (Disruptive Writing Assignment)

> Create a world that is really realistic/hyperreal and “feels like documentary rather than a fiction”. 
>> It should be mundane and almost boring to the point where it’s just a peaceful story, with little to no intrigue, just plot with exposition of a very boring world.
>>> But out of the blue, random acts of violence are interspersed, but without changing the above described tone, or being noticed by the world or actors/characters of the otherwise mundane story/“plot line”/script/idea/code/demo/[INSERT-YOUR-MEDIUM-HERE].

#### This is the general assignment, should you take it (or offer your suggestions for the improvement of others). It’s open to a lot of interpretations, and I’m curious to see what we all do.

*Note:
Part of the choice of using GitHub as the hub for this project is the nature of versioning and collaboration that is inherent here.*
*Wouldn’t it be fun to look back on your (Combined?) work, in one collective cluster, with overlaps and inspiration (or perhaps none, if this just stagnates and dies). At least I think it’s cool, and I hope you agree, but if not, that’s ok tool. Maybe there’s a better way? Let us know!*

*Sub Note: We would have prefered this file be called "INSTRUCTIONS.md", but my brain has it's own crazily specific desired conventions... readme just seems so needy...*
