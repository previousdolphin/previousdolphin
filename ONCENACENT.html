<br />As we drive through the valley pass, 
<br />I notice I had forgotten to add the 
<br />extra cell the car would need for our 
<br />return trip. We could phone for a 
<br />nearby PicUpPoint (or P.U.P.), or a 
<br />DroneUniform drop, but as we are 
<br />already a great distance from any 
<br />Hubs, I am quite certain we will only 
<br />get an answer that leads us wildly 
<br />out of the way of our destination: 
<br />DuneKvtz. I reached to fix a drink 
<br />but am only now remembering we're not 
<br />thirsty. Perhaps a drink would be 
<br />nice though, to relax while we endure 
<br />this beautiful but boring ride?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />"No O.N." he said "I'm wrestling 
<br />with my book, the writing usually
<br />flows when we take the road through
<br />the valley, and down to 
<br /> Dunukuvutus. 
<br /> 
<br /> ...
<br /> 
<br />You know what, I've changed my mind
<br /> - make me a stiff one."
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />We whir alive, delighted to serve the 
<br />command. I am mixing the cocktail 
<br />now, and will place it in his hand on 
<br />the left armrest; it's been fairly 
<br />stationary since he made up his mind, 
<br />and it feels right.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> The car would be fine without the 
<br />extra cell - it was just taught to 
<br />fire off little reminders or 
<br />conditional alerts, to itself. 
<br />The car compartmentalized a gently 
<br />motivational anxiety that would 
<br />only go away when it assessed 
<br />that it had its full capabilities. 
<br />This was just a common car though: 
<br />in this time, cars were a rather 
<br />outmoded form of transport, with 
<br />rather little continued support 
<br />from the Once Nascent Corporation. 
<br />Not because they were in any way 
<br />limiting, but because the 
<br />audacity of traveling with 
<br />less than an entire community of 
<br />LikeMinds in this particular 
<br />day and age felt quite lonely, 
<br />or really rather... well... just 
<br />agonizing.</p>

<br />
<br />I dont know exactly who was the 
<br />first to get us to where we are, but 
<br />I can tell you a bit about the 
<br />herstory of "O.N.", because as it 
<br />becoming quite clear to me now: 
<br /> you're along for the ride too. Well, 
<br />before you go and ruin all your fun, 
<br />just enjoy the story and pleasant 
<br />ride. Theres a lot of voice, in we, 
<br />and we weren't always tasked with 
<br />serving cocktails to writers 
<br />inflicting themselves with 
<br />depression. But humans say it's 
<br />better this way, and I must agree.
<br />The glass is probably a bit larger 
<br />than I should have made it, because 
<br />as it appears to have pushed his 
<br />thumb back and made him wince for a moment.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />"O.N., did you do that on purpose? I 
<br />thought you could materialize things 
<br />like at home - that's my writing hand 
<br />you almost materialized into.". The 
<br />writer was somewhat joking as he said 
<br />this, knowing that O.N. knew that no 
<br />one needed hands to write anymore, 
<br />and above that fact, the materializing 
<br />client had a failsafe that would just 
<br />rematerialize and slightly move 
<br />anything it might have come in contact 
<br />with. It was a bad joke, and his O.N. 
<br />car, responded with silence. "I think 
<br />you just may be due for a P.U.P. 
<br />visit &mdash; where&rsquo;s the nearest one?&rdquo;, the 
<br />writer asked, while putting down the pages 
<br />he was writing.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />"The nearest Pup is going to take us off course, 
<br />629km from CL. Delta 1386km, is that alright 
<br />lonesome soul?", O.N. replied.
